This code generates one plot per synset, showing the distribution of synset features per layer. Each plot shows several lines corresponding to different thresholds for determining the synset features (e.g., 30% implies 30% of images must share a feature to become a synset feature). Each plot shows as many lines as thresholds (these are currently hardcoded in a list within the file).

This plot is useful for understanding the relevance of the threshold, and how it changes the synset features.
