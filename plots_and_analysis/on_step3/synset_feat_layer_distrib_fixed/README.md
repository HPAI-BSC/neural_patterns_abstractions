This code plots a diagram per synset. Each diagram shows the distribution of synset features per layer (one line per plot). Two versions are generated, one with the vertical axis in absolute terms, and one with the vertical axis normalized to percentatge (that is, percentatge of features of the layer which are within the synset features). Synset feature threshold is hardcoded at 50%.

This plot is useful to understand the composition of synset features, and how different synsets are characterized differently.
