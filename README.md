# Semantic Transfer

In this repository we will perform an analysis about the relation between the embedding of some synsets and their semantic relationships. 

We use the next resources: 
- The Imagenet 2012 validation dataset (1000 clases, 50k images)
- The Full Network Embedding implemented with Tiramisu.

We do several steps to generate the necesary data for this analysis. For this reason the repository is divided in one folder per each step. 

### First Step
For this step you need a python with nltk installed. 

**Input**: A file with all the names of the images and its correspondent class ( writed as an imagenet synset). 

file: step-1/data/imagenet2012_val_synset_codes.txt

**Output**:The partitions of all the synsets with more than 1000 images.

For each synset it will create two files in data: 

-  data/synset_partitions/name_imgs.npz
-  data/synset_partitions/name_hypernims.txt


### Second Step
This code is in:  /gpfs/projects/bsc28/semantic_transfer_scripts/code

First we generate a tiramisu folder. TODO: explain this step. 

**Input**: The files generated on the step 1 of the folder data/all_synset_partitions_npz/synset/ . There are 55 files. 


**Output**:The folders with the symbolic links on tiramisu_nicename/imgs for every one of the selected synsets. 

For this example if we take the synset 'dog', the structure of links generated by this code will be: 

- tiramisu_nicename/imgs/dog/train/dog/images0008.JPEG

- tiramisu_nicename/imgs/dog/train/no_dog/images00058.JPEG


### Third Step
The main objective of this step is to create all the embeddings for the selected synsets. 
To do so, we will use the tiramisu3.0 code on the minotauro.

**Input**:  The folders with the symbolic links on tiramisu_nicename/imgs for every one of the selected synsets. 


**Output**: One embedding per synset selected.

### Fourth Step
This code is in: /gpfs/projects/bsc28/semantic_transfer_scripts/code/embedding_reader.py

In this step we extract the features with more than the 50% of images with value one on the embedding
for each one of the synsets selected.

This way is expected to obtain a list of the features that represent the synset the most. 

**Input**:  One embedding per synset selected.

**Output**: A npz file with the representative features per synset.
 his file also has a dictionary with the layer architecture.
