### Second Step
This code generates the directory structure needed by Tiramisu 3.0 to produce the FNE. 
This structure is analogous to the one needed by TensorFlow, and is also compatible with 
other deep learning frameworks.

**Input**: The files generated on the step 1 of the folder data/all_synset_partitions_npz/synset/ 


**Output**:The folders with the symbolic links on ../data/imgs for every one of the selected synsets. 

For this example if we take the synset 'dog', the structure of links generated by this code will be: 
 

- data/imgs/dog/train/dog/images0008.JPEG

- t/imgs/dog/train/no_dog/images00058.JPEG

In order to run this code in marenostrum we need a python with numpy. 
The next versions of python contain it:
 
Minoturo:

module load K80 impi/2018.1 mkl/2018.1 cuda/8.0 CUDNN/7.0.3 python/3.6.3_ML


Marenostrum 4: 

module load K80 impi/2018.1 mkl/2018.1 cuda/8.0 CUDNN/7.0.3 
python/2.7.12_ML

Once you create the structure, if you need to run the step3, you have to copy the data/imgs/ folder to tiramisu_semantic_transfer/imgs/
