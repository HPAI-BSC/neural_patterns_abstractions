This code is in: /gpfs/projects/bsc28/semantic_transfer_scripts/step-4

In this step we extract the more representative features for each of the synsets selected.

Then we save them as a numpy npz file containing: the array of the features that had mayority of images with value 1, and a dictionary with the architecture of the fne used. 

All this files are saved on: 

/gpfs/projects/bsc28/semantic_transfer_scripts/step-4/data/feature_lists
